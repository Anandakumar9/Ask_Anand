## Quick Start

### Run Security Test

```powershell
cd studypulse/backend
.\scripts\run-shannon-security-test.ps1
```

### Monthly Audit

```powershell
cd studypulse/backend
.\scripts\monthly-security-audit.ps1
```

## Reports

Security reports are automatically generated by Shannon and saved in `reports/`.

### Report Naming
- **Monthly Audits:** `audit-YYYY-MM.md`
- **Pre-Release:** `pre-release-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Ad-hoc Tests:** `shannon-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

### Report Retention
- Keep last 12 monthly reports
- Older reports are automatically archived
- Critical findings are tracked separately

## Security Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Action Timeline |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Immediate exploit risk | Fix within 24 hours |
| **HIGH** | Significant vulnerability | Fix before next deploy |
| **MEDIUM** | Potential security issue | Fix in next sprint |
| **LOW** | Minor security concern | Backlog |

## Common Findings & Fixes

See `SHANNON_SECURITY_SETUP.md` in project root for detailed fix guides.

## Workflow

1. **Run Shannon** → Generate report
2. **Review Findings** → Triage by severity
3. **Create Issues** → Track in GitHub
4. **Implement Fixes** → Document in `fixes/`
5. **Verify** → Re-run Shannon
6. **Archive** → Move to archive when resolved

## Automation

### GitHub Actions
Security tests run automatically:
- On every PR to main/master
- Monthly on the 1st
- Manually via workflow dispatch

### Local Testing
Use scripts in `scripts/` directory:
- `run-shannon-security-test.ps1` - Run security test
- `monthly-security-audit.ps1` - Full monthly audit
