It is also referred to as morbidly adherent placenta, The major problem if placenta accreta syndrome occurs is failure of placenta tto separate normally from the myometrium after fetal delivery. Attempts to seperate an adherent placenta can lead to torrential hemorrhage This abnormal adherence stems in part from partial or total absence of the decidua basalis and imperfect development of the fibrinoid or Nitabuch layer If the decidual spongy layer is lacking either partially or totally, the physiological line of cleavage is absent, and some or all cotyledons are densely anchored.

Avoid an emergency cesarean unless really required. The cesarean is usually a classical cesarean (upper segment) as the most common site of adherence is in the lower segment (usually at the site of a previous cesarean section) After delivery of the baby, the cord is clamped; no attempt at separation of placenta is done and a hysterectomy is done. Leaving the placenta in situ is not preferred to be done but has been occasionally reported by a few.

Combined Oral Contraceptives : Certain combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs), which contain both estrogen and progestin, can be used for emergency contraception. This method, known as the Yuzpe regimen. It's less effective and has more side effects than other emergency contraceptive options.</li><li>• Option A.</li><li>• Combined Oral Contraceptives</li><li>• Option B . Levonorgestrel : This is a common and effective ingredient in many emergency contraceptive pills. It's a progestin-only pill taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) or in two doses (0.75 mg each, 12 hours apart) within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. It's well-tolerated and has fewer side effects than the Yuzpe regimen.</li><li>• Option B</li><li>• Levonorgestrel</li><li>• Option C . Ulipristal Acetate : This is another effective option for emergency contraception. It's a single-dose pill (30 mg) that can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse. It's more effective than levonorgestrel and can be used for a longer window after intercourse.</li><li>• Option C</li><li>• Ulipristal Acetate</li><li>• Option D . Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) (Correct Answer): DMPA is a long-acting progestin contraceptive administered via injection and is not suitable for emergency contraception.

There is, however, no change in the basal gonadotropin level while the estrogen levels are reduced. Reduces the liver synthesis of SHBG and as such, free testosterone is increased which in turn causes endometrial atrophy.

Oxytocin is discontinued if there are excessive contractions or if there is a persistent non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern to ensure the safety of the mother and the baby. Option B: The uterus contracts within 3 to 5 minutes of beginning an oxytocin infusion, and a plasma steady state is reached in 40 minutes: This statement is correct. Oxytocin typically starts to induce uterine contractions within a few minutes of administration, and it reaches a steady state in plasma relatively quickly. Option C : When oxytocin is stopped, its concentration in plasma falls slowly because the half-life is long: This statement is incorrect. Oxytocin has a very short half-life, typically in the range of 1-6 minutes. Therefore, its concentration in plasma drops rapidly after discontinuation. Option D : Oxytocin is started at doses of 0.5 – 1.5 mIU/ml and gradually increased to a maximum of 48mIU/ml: statement is generally accurate. Oxytocin is typically started at low doses and gradually increased to achieve the desired uterine contractions while avoiding excessive stimulation.</li><li>• Option A: Oxytocin is discontinued if the number of contractions is > 5 in a 10-minute period or > 7 in a 15-minute period or with a persistent non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern.: This statement is correct.

In general, oxytocin is discontinued if the number of contractions persists with a frequency of more than five in a 10-minute period or more than seven in a 15-minute period or with a persistent non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern. The uterus contracts within 3 to 5 minutes of beginning an oxytocin infusion, and a plasma steady state is reached in 40 minutes Oxytocin discontinuation nearly always rapidly lowers contraction frequency. When oxytocin is stopped, its concentration in plasma rapidly falls because the half-life is approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Uterine response to oxytocin increases from 20 to 30 weeks’ gestation and rises rapidly at term.

Abnormal luteal function may occur as the result of several medical conditions. True isolated LPD implies an underlying pathologic abnormality of the luteal phase in the absence of an identifiable disease process negatively affecting normal LH support of the corpus luteum. No diagnostic test for LPD has proven to be reliable in the clinical setting or in differentiating fertile from infertile women.

Fertile women have the same incidence of luteal phase deficiency as infertile women (Correct Answer): Recent studies and reviews suggest that the incidence of LPD is similar in both fertile and infertile women.

Surgical therapy is preferred over medical therapy : This is generally not true. Medical therapy, typically with dopamine agonists like bromocriptine or cabergoline, is the first-line treatment for hyperprolactinemia, including that caused by micro-prolactinomas. These medications are effective in reducing prolactin levels and often lead to tumor shrinkage. Surgical therapy is usually reserved for cases where medical therapy is ineffective or not tolerated.</li><li>• Option A.</li><li>• Surgical therapy is preferred over medical therapy</li><li>• Option B. During pregnancy, cabergoline is preferred over bromocriptine : Actually, bromocriptine is generally preferred over cabergoline during pregnancy.

Clomiphene citrate may be ineffective for ovulation induction (Correct Answer): This is true. Clomiphene citrate is an ovulation induction agent that works by blocking estrogen receptors, leading to an increase in the release of FSH and LH. However, in the presence of elevated prolactin levels, as seen in hyperprolactinemia, the effectiveness of clomiphene may be diminished. Therefore, normalizing prolactin levels with dopamine agonists is often necessary before or in conjunction with using clomiphene.</li><li>• Option C.</li><li>• Clomiphene citrate may be ineffective for ovulation induction</li><li>• Option D. Dopamine-agonist therapy should be increased once pregnancy is achieved : This is not typically recommended. In fact, dopamine agonist therapy is often discontinued once pregnancy is confirmed in women with micro-prolactinomas. This is because the risk of tumor growth during pregnancy is low, and the safety of continued use of these drugs during pregnancy is not fully established.</li><li>• Option D.</li><li>• Dopamine-agonist therapy should be increased once pregnancy is achieved</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>➤ Educational Objective</li><li>➤ First-line treatment of hyper-prolactinemia with a mico-adenoma typically involves medical therapy with dopamine agonists, which are effective in lowering prolactin levels and can restore ovulatory function.</li><li>➤ First-line treatment of hyper-prolactinemia with a mico-adenoma typically involves medical therapy with dopamine agonists, which are effective in lowering prolactin levels and can restore ovulatory function.</li><li>➤ Ref: Page 450, Williams Gynecology 3 rd edition</li><li>➤ Ref: Page 450, Williams Gynecology 3 rd edition</li></ul>\n<p>@dams_new_robot</p>",

In utero, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons develop in the olfactory placode. These neurons migrate through the forebrain to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus by 11 weeks’ gestation. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide, is influenced by higher cortical centers and is released from these neurons in a pulsatile fashion into the pituitary portal plexus. As a result, by mid gestation, the GnRH “pulse generator” stimulates secretion of gonadotropins, that is, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), from the anterior pituitary. In turn, the pulsatile release of gonadotropins stimulates ovarian synthesis and release of gonadal steroid hormones. Concurrently, accelerated germ cell division and follicular development begins, resulting in the creation of 6 to 7 million oocytes by 5 months’ gestation. By late gestation, gonadal steroids exert negative feedback on secretion of both hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary gonadotropins. During this time, oocyte number decreases through a process of gene related apoptosis to reach a level of 1 to 2 million by birth At birth, FSH and LH concentrations rise abruptly in response to the fall in placental estrogen levels and are highest in the first 3 months of life. This transient rise in gonadotropin levels is followed by an increase in gonadal steroid concentrations, which is thought to explain instances of neonatal breast budding, minor bleeding from endometrial shedding, short-lived ovarian cysts, and transient white vaginal mucous discharge. Following these initial months, gonadotropin levels gradually decline to reach prepubertal levels by age 1 to 2 years. The childhood years are thus characterized by low plasma levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol.
